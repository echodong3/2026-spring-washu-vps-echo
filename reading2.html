        In The New Turing Test, Elan Ullendorff proposes a new Turing Test that challenges the role of AI in today's society and its purpose to elevate human's creativity.
        He argues that we should not focus and debate on whether AI work is ethical but how to better collaborate with the tool to express our creativity and ideas. 
        The incoporation of AI in daily work is inevitable, and we should utilise its power to produce work that emotionally connect with others or leave a lasting impression.
        I find the concept of expressiveness as a new Turing test really interesting. The three criteria of creating works that come from someone, meant for someone, and belonging to a particular context 
        feel really relevate to me, and it encourages me to reflect on how I should use AI in the future to create more meaningul works.
