        This interview talked about how restaurants' websites have evolved over the years with the advance of technology. 
        Old websites are more "expressive and freeform" compared to the templated websites today. 
        The manually made websites before adds "personality" to the restaurants and showcase the atmosphere of the restaurant really well.
        I can resonate with this because I think the development of AI and website builder tools may make the process easier but they lose a lot of uniqueness.
