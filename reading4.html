1. <b>What did you think about the essay? Did anything in particular resonate?</b>
I found the essay interesting because it challenges the idea that websites must be polished, optimized, or tied to personal branding. What resonated most with me was the idea that a website is a living, unfinished space rather than a final product. The way Schwulst critiques social media platforms and emphasizes individual control over one’s own website made me rethink the web as something shaped by personal intention rather than corporate systems.<br>

2. <b>Laurel proposes a website could be a river, a garden, or a thrown rock. If you have a website, what could your website be?</b> 
If I were to imagine my own website, it would be closest to a garden. It would be a space where ideas are planted over time, allowed to grow slowly, and sometimes left alone. Some sections might be carefully maintained while others remain experimental or unfinished, reflecting the natural, uneven process of creative thinking.<br>

3. <b>What can you do with a website that you make yourself that you can’t do if someone else makes your website?</b>
When you make your own website, you have full control over its structure, pacing, and purpose. You can decide how content is organized, how users move through the space, and when or if it gets updated. Unlike platforms built by others, a self-made website allows for ambiguity, slowness, and personal values without being shaped by algorithms, templates, or commercial priorities.<br>
